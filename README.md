## Flight Price Predictor

Final project for the Building AI course.

## Summary

Flight Price Predictor is an AI-powered tool designed to analyze airfare trends and predict the best time to book flights at the lowest price. By leveraging real-time data and historical pricing patterns, it helps travelers save money and make informed booking decisions.

## Background

Flight prices change all the time, and it can be really frustrating to figure out when to book to get the best deal. As an international student who travels a lot but does not have unlimited money, I want to create a tool that would help me (and others) book flights at the right time - when they are cheapest.

## How is it used?

This tool could help anyone who wants to travel and save money, making it useful for people from all kinds of backgrounds. Having a tool that predicts when to book could be super helpful and could make travelling more accessible. 

## Data sources and AI methods

The AI model would be based on supervised learning, using historical flight price data to find patterns. The data would be collected by tracking airline websites (method to be determined). Things like luggage allowances could be added manually, and users could also help by sharing available discounts - similar to how Waze users share traffic updates.

## Challenges

* Predictions will noť always be accurate – flight prices are influenced by a lot of unpredictable factors, like demand changes, airline policies, and external events. While the AI can identify trends, it wwill not guarantee the lowest price every time.
* Airline countermeasures – if this tool becomes popular, airlines may adjust pricing strategies to prevent predictive tools from working effectively.
* Data collection – continuously gathering and maintaining accurate price data from airline websites could be technically challenging, especially if airlines restrict access or change how they display prices.

## What next?

The initial prototype will focus on tracking price trends for specific airlines. Future improvements and extensions could include:
* Comparing prices across multiple airlines
* Factoring in luggage allowances and personal travel preferences (e.g., morning vs. evening flights)
* Identifying and integrating available discounts, such as student fares
* Developing a user-friendly web interface to make the tool accessible to travelers

To move forward, I will first need to establish an efficient method for data collection, followed by training the AI model. Finally, an attractive web development will be necessary to make the tool widely available.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank my friend Šimon, who originally came up with this idea and had a long discussion with me about developing this tool.
